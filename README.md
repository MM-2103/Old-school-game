# 2d Platformer made with C++ and SDL2

## What is this?

This is an 2d platfomer game made with C++ and the SDL2 media library, the game was made for school and learning C++

## SDL2

Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) is a cross-platform software development library designed to provide a hardware abstraction layer for computer multimedia hardware components (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_DirectMedia_Layer)
SDL2 is used widely for developing game and has a large community and a lot of guides/tutorials so that is why I choose it.

## OOP

Anoter goal of the project was to practice Object-Oriented programming so I tried in this project as much as possible to adhere to the oop standards. It proved a bit hard especially with the fact that the SDL2 library is C code (so no classes).
Nevertheless I believe I succeded at writing clean C++ code that makes heavy use of classes
